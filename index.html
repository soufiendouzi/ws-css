    <p>CSS is an essential technology for web developers, allowing them to create visually appealing and responsive websites. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create a complete web development stack.</p>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used in web development to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media.</p>
